The Apicurious individual mini-project at the Turing School teaches students how to consume APIs
by exposing them to a popular web application's API and asking them to replicate the application using its own API.
As part of the project, students must implement OAuth in their applications along with several other features depending on the original application's functionality.

### Instructions

- run `git clone git@github.com:mrjaimisra/the_pivot.git`
- run `rails s`, access `http://localhost:3000` in your browser
- to run the tests, run `bundle exec rspec`
